# DALI Challenges

![](docs/imgs/dali-mondays.gif)

For new applicants to the DALI Lab we ask for some code and design challenges.  DALI hires two levels of designers and developers based on experience and motivation.  You may apply for designer/dev I or II by completing some of the following challenges.

These challenges allow you try your hand at some design and some web coding as well as the ins and outs of an essential concept used in software design and development — version control. We'll be using git and github (the site you're at now!) to learn how manage multiple people working on the same document at the same time — all while having the ability to backup and revert your work. If this is all new to you, don't worry! We'll start from the beginning and build from there.

## DALI Level I Challenges

DALI members are pretty cool, so we'd like each of you to design a web page telling us about yourself! It's up to you whether you want to build your page using html/css/js (follow details in [Dev Details](./docs/dev1_details.md)) or if you want to create your design in Sketch (follow details in [Design Details](./docs/design1_details.md)). If you're feeling adventurous, try both! How much you do is up to you, but at the very least, complete either the design or the dev flow. Be creative! Your design should tell us something about your personality, so consider this when you make choices about type, color, and decisions about your layout.

### Your page should include the following information:
* A picture of yourself
* Your name
* Where you’re from/where you live
* A short bio telling us about yourself (you might include/mention: design/programming applications you know/like, what you enjoy most about ui/ux design/development, why you’re excited to work with DALI.)
* Something interesting/fun/random about yourself :smile:

## DALI Level II Challenges

At DALI, we have over 50 students per term working on a variety of cool projects.  Things can get pretty chaotic.  It would help if we had an app or a site that displayed a DALI Dashboard!   This dashboard could show active and past members,  profiles,  skillsets,  and current projects for DALI Members. It could show some visualizations of where members come from and what they are working on. Additionally it could have project information and potentially show a record of the processes as well.  

For instance, imagine that you had access to data that includes:

<pre>
Members: {
  name, gender,year,
  photoUrl, website ,linkedin, greeting, githubUsername:,
  location, coverPhoto, skills, projects, role
}
</pre>

How would you visualize this?    Design an app or website or dashboard portal that you imagine could help members,  partners, and anybody interested to explore members and projects.  This could be anything.  The goal here is to come up with a solution that you think could be useful and then do a full design on it.  Your list of deliverables should include:   highres mockups in a design software of your choosing,  an app flow of how the various views interact,  and a design style guide that outlines the various design choices you made for the app (colors, fonts, etc).  



If you have any questions, we encourage you to email us or stop by 007 Sudikoff during DALI Open Lab Hours (every Monday 6-9pm).
