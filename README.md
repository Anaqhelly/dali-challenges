# DALI Developer Challenges👩🏾‍💻

![](docs/imgs/dali-mondays.gif)

There are several challenges you may complete as a DALI applicant. To be considered as a lab member, you must complete at least one of the challenges and you should choose whichever you feel best showcases your skills and interests.

These challenges allow you try your hand at some design and some coding as well as the ins and outs of an essential concept used in software design and development — version control. We'll be using git and GitHub (the site you're at now!) to learn how to manage multiple people working on the same document at the same time — all while having the ability to backup and revert your work. If this is all new to you, don't worry! We'll start from the beginning and build from there.

If you get stuck, don't be discouraged! If you have any questions, we encourage you to email us at applications@dali.dartmouth.edu or stop by Sudikoff 007 during DALI Open Lab Hours (every Monday 5-8pm).

## All Challenges🏃‍♂️

Show us your coding skills! We’ll ask you to submit 2 - 3 coding samples that you are proud of and think is representative of your skills! One small catch - **at least one** of your samples has to be one of our DALI Developer Challenges. These challenges help emulate some of the real work we do in DALI, and give us an opportunity to see how well you work with guidelines.

### Basic Webpage Challenge 🐭

DALI members are pretty cool, so we'd like you to design a web page telling us about yourself! Build your page using html/css/js (follow details in [Dev Details](#detailed-instructions)). Be creative and adventurous! If you are really passionate about writing, add some blog posts, if you really enjoy photography, integrate your 500px portfolio, and maybe you love to travel, include a cool map visualizing all of the places you have visited. Your design should tell us something about your personality, so consider this when you make choices about the design, layout, and various components of your website.

#### Overview

Your page should include the following information:

* A picture of yourself
* Your name
* Where you’re from or where you live
* A short bio telling us about yourself (you might include/mention: design/programming applications you know/like, what you enjoy most about UI/US design/development, why you’re excited to work with DALI.)
* Something interesting/fun/random about yourself :smile:

**Inspiration**

Below are some examples of awesome pages that DALI Lab members have created that you could base your personal pages on.
