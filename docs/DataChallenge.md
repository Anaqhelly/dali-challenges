# Free Form Data Challenge üìà

Not a front-end or back-end fan? Not feeling like recreating social media? Feeling a little adventurous and creative? This is the challenge for you.

### Overview

In this challenge, we've compiled a few arbitrary data sets of some current and previous DALI members! The data set includes many features, some informational, some fun, and some just random. We're challenging you, to do something creative with this data set!

### Guidelines

Honestly, there are none. As long as you use one of our provided data sets and incorporate it into your challenge.

### Suggestions üßê

Feeling a little lost? Here are some example directions you can take with this project!

1. Machine Learning. Show us some of your machine learning skills, and maybe see if you can find any revealing or interesting correlations. Here are our favorite frameworks and ML tools:
    - Python [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), a great place for beginners and advanced alike. An amazing, comprehensive framework that is both easy to start with, and extremely deep.
    - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) from Google, is another popular Machine Learning framework - has great support for working with deep learning and neural networks
2. Data Visualization. Show us something pretty from the data, and make a beautiful interactive UI to let us visualize the data! Here are some of our favorite tools for data visualization in the front end:
    - [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a phenomenal Javascript library that makes web visualizations incredibly easy and powerful
    - [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is another powerful Javascript visualization library
    - Python's [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) is a classic - easy to use, and runs straight on the terminal!
3. ... or, as one would say, "por que no los dos"! Some sort of visualization of your machine learning project!
4. Be creative! If you're not feeling particularly creative but want to do something frontend-y or backend-y, check out the set of Social Media challenges!
