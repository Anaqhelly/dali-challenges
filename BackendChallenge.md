# Backend Challenge

This challenge allows your backend skills to really shine!âœ¨

## Overview

At DALI, we have over 70 students per term working on a variety of projects. As we get more members in the lab, the more personalities that we meet! It would be helpful to have a webserver that could hold DALI member related information and provide endpoints and functions for developers to interact with data.

## Objective

Create a webserver or API that allows other developers to access and interact with the data. This is fairly broad so you have the most freedom to interpret this challenge. There are few things that you should keep in mind when you are working through this challenge:

1. Create a REST API with at least GET/POST routes
2. Add extra functionality beyond just sending back data to the requester
3. This API doesn't need to be publically hosted, but we want to have it run locally on our machines with either [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

This challenge is language-agnostic! So feel free to use Javascript, Python, Java, or whatever feels most comfortable to you.

## Instructions

We've collected data on lab members so you don't have to!

There are two version of data in JSON files that you can use:

1. [Public data](./data/Dali_Data.json) - each chunk has a lab member's name with unique information
2. [Anonymous data](./data/Dali_Data-Anon.json) - each chunk doesn't have a name attached with some different data

Here are some things to think about:

1. Imagine that this API needs to be used for a data visualization project. What type of endpoints would you create to make it for front end developers?
2. How would you connect fairly similar types of chunks to one another?
3. Try to get creative by incorporating both data sets into your API.

## Tips
To make the development process easy, consider reading through this list

1. Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for a better development environment
2. `yarn` is a slightly faster node package manager
3. Consider using the following frameworks
    * `express` for Javascript
    * `Flask` for Python

The more creative you get with this challenge, the better! If you have any questions feel free to email the [DALI Lab](mailto:staff@dali.dartmouth.edu). Good luckðŸš€
